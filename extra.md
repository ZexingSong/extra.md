At the beginning, the error rate is very large, and I tried to see the each step of regularization and learning rates, I increased the value of regularization to 
0.015 and decreased the momentum to 0.7. And I tried to change the learning rate to 0.0015 but the result is not good. Therefore, for the Hyperparaemters tuning, 
only changed the value of regularization and the size the momentum.
